Frappe ships with a system for running jobs in the background. It is implemented by using the [schedule package](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) and a simple long-running infinite [while loop](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/d0efa8e3ff734268a30b4804427641d2a5ed643e/frappe/utils/scheduler.py).

You can enqueue a python method to run in the background by using the `frappe.enqueue` method:
[code] 
    def long_running_job(param1, param2):
     # expensive tasks
     pass
    
    # directly pass the function
    frappe.enqueue(long_running_job, queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')
    
    # or pass the full module path as string
    frappe.enqueue('app.module.folder.long_running_job', queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')
    
[/code]

Here are all the possible arguments you can pass to the `enqueue`:
[code] 
    frappe.enqueue(
     method, # python function or a module path as string
     queue="default", # one of short, default, long
     timeout=None, # pass timeout manually
     is_async=True, # if this is True, method is run in worker
     now=False, # if this is True, method is run directly (not in a worker) 
     job_name=None, # specify a job name
     enqueue_after_commit=False, # enqueue the job after the database commit is done at the end of the request
     at_front=False, # put the job at the front of the queue
     **kwargs, # kwargs are passed to the method as arguments
    )
    
[/code]

You can also enqueue a [Document](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/api/document) method by using `frappe.enqueue_doc`:
[code] 
    frappe.enqueue_doc(
     doctype,
     name,
     "do_something", # name of the controller method
     queue="long",
     timeout=4000,
     param="value"
    )
    
[/code]

## Queue

There are 3 default queues that are configured with the framework: `short`, `default`, and `long`. Each queue has a default timeout as follows:

  * short: 300 seconds
  * default: 300 seconds
  * long: 1500 seconds



You can also pass a custom timeout to the `enqueue` method.

### Custom Queues

You can add custom queues by configuring them in `[common_site_config.json](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/site_config)`:
[code] 
    {
     ...
     "workers": {
     "myqueue": {
     "timeout": 5000, # queue timeout
     "background_workers": 4, # number of workers for this queue
     } 
     }
    }
    
[/code]

## Workers

By default Frappe sets up 3 worker types for consuming from each queue. The default configuration looks like this:
[code] 
    bench worker --queue short
    bench worker --queue default
    bench worker --queue long
    
[/code]

In production these 3 worker processes are replicated to configured number of background workers to handle higher workloads.

NOTE: This way of mapping workers to single queue is just a convention and it's not necessary to follow it.

### Multi-queue consumption

You can specify more than one queue for workers to consume from by specifying a comma separate string of queue names.

Example: If you wanted to combine short and default workers and only use two types of workers instead of default configuration then you can modify your worker configuration like this:
[code] 
    bench worker --queue short,default
    bench worker --queue long
    
[/code]

NOTE: The examples shown here are for Procfile format but they can be applied to supervisor or systemd configurations easily too.

### Burst Mode using `--burst`
[code] 
    bench worker --queue short --burst
    
[/code]

This command will spawn a tempoary worker that will start consuming short queue and quit once queue is empty. If you periodically need higher amount of workers then you can use your OS's crontab to setup burst workers at specific times.

## Scheduler Events

You can use Scheduler Events for running tasks periodically in the background using the `scheduler_events` hook.

**app/hooks.py**
[code] 
    scheduler_events = {
     "hourly": [
     # will run hourly
     "app.scheduled_tasks.update_database_usage"
     ],
    }
    
[/code]

**app/scheduled_tasks.py**
[code] 
    def update_database_usage():
     pass
    
[/code]

> After changing any scheduled events in hooks.py, you need to run bench migrate for changes to take effect.

### Available Events

  * `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly`



These events will trigger every hour, day, week, and month respectively.

  * `hourly_long`, `daily_long`, `weekly_long`, `monthly_long`



Same as above but these jobs are run in the [long worker](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/directory-structure) suitable for long-running jobs.

  * `all`



The `all` event is triggered every 60 seconds. This can be configured via the `scheduler_tick_interval` key in `[common_site_config.json](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/sites)`

  * `cron`



A valid cron string that can be parsed by [croniter](https://pypi.org/project/croniter/).

Usage Examples:
[code] 
    scheduler_events = {
     "daily": [
     "app.scheduled_tasks.manage_recurring_invoices"
     ],
     "daily_long": [
     "app.scheduled_tasks.take_backups_daily"
     ],
     "cron": {
     "15 18 * * *": [
     "app.scheduled_tasks.delete_all_barcodes_for_users"
     ],
     "*/6 * * * *": [
     "app.scheduled_tasks.collect_error_snapshots"
     ],
     "annual": [
     "app.scheduled_tasks.collect_error_snapshots"
     ]
     }
    }
    
[/code]
