Form Scripts are client-side javascript code that enhances the UX of your Forms.

Let's say you want to create a membership for a member. To do this, you have to go to the Library Membership list, create a new form, select the member and other fields and then save.

Similarly, when you want to create a transaction against a member, you have to make a new Library Transaction form.

We can make this process easier. Write the following code in **library_member.js**
[code] 
    frappe.ui.form.on("Library Member", {
      refresh: function (frm) {
        frm.add_custom_button("Create Membership", () => {
          frappe.new_doc("Library Membership", {
            library_member: frm.doc.name,
          });
        });
        frm.add_custom_button("Create Transaction", () => {
          frappe.new_doc("Library Transaction", {
            library_member: frm.doc.name,
          });
        });
      },
    });
    
[/code]

Now, refresh your page and go to the Library Member form. You should see two buttons on the top right. Click on them to try them out. They will automatically set the Library Member in each of those documents making the process easier.
