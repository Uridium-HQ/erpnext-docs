Each site comes with a database. They may be customized throughsite specific scripting or Apps may be installed on them.

## Create a new site

To create a new site, run the following command from the `frappe-bench` directory:
[code] 
    $ bench new-site library.test
    MySQL root password:
    
    Installing frappe...
    Updating DocTypes for frappe        : [========================================] 100%
    Updating country info               : [========================================] 100%
    Set Administrator password:
    Re-enter Administrator password:
    *** Scheduler is disabled ***
    Current Site set to library.test
    
    
[/code]

This command will create a new database, so you need to enter your MySQL root password. It will also ask to set the password for the Administrator user, just set a password that you won't forget. This will be useful later.

Now, you will have a new folder named `library.test` in the `sites` directory.

## Site Directory Structure

The site directory structure will look something like this:
[code] 
    sites/library.test
    ├── indexes
    │   └── web_routes
    ├── locks
    ├── logs
    ├── private
    │   ├── backups
    │   └── files
    ├── public
    │   └── files
    └── site_config.json
    
    
    
[/code]

The `indexes` folder has indexes generated via [Website Search](../python-api/search.md).

The `locks` folder maintains file based locks over in-site documents as well as indicators of the state of the site itself.

As you can see, the `private` folder will contain any database backups and private files. Private files are user uploaded files that need authentication to be accessible.

The `public` folder will contain files that are accessible without authentication. This can contain website images that should be accessible without login.

The `site_config.json` file contains configuration that is specific to this site which should not be version controlled. This is similar to an environment variables file. If you look at the contents of the file, it contains the database configuration values for this site.
[code] 
    {
     "db_name": "_ad03fa1a016ca1c4",
     "db_password": "pz1d2gN5y35ydRO5",
     "db_type": "mariadb"
    }
    
    
[/code]

## Access site in your browser

`bench` allows you to create multiple sites and access them separately in the browser on the same port. This is what we call multi-tenancy support in bench.

Frappe will identify which site to serve by matching the hostname of the request with the site name, so you should be able to access your site on http://library.test:8000 but this won't work because we have to tell our operating system that library.test should point to localhost. To do that, you can add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file.
[code] 
    127.0.0.1 library.test
    
    
[/code]

This will map `library.test` to `localhost`. Bench has a convenient command to do just that.
[code] 
    $ bench --site library.test add-to-hosts
    
    
[/code]

This will ask for your root password and will add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file.

Great, now you can access your site at http://library.test:8000. Congratulations for making it this far.

## Install app on site

To install our Library Management app on our site, run the following command:
[code] 
    $ bench --site library.test install-app library_management
    
    Installing library_management...
    
    
[/code]

To confirm if the app was installed, run the following command:
[code] 
    $ bench --site library.test list-apps
    frappe
    library_management
    
    
[/code]

You should see `frappe` and `library_management` as installed apps on your site.

> When you create a new site, the `frappe` app is installed by default.

## Login to Desk

To create DocTypes in our app, we must log in to Desk. Go to http://library.test:8000 and it should show you a login page.

Enter Administrator as the user and password that you set while creating the site.

![Setup Wizard](https://docs.frappe.io/assets/3c0885225d03.png)

After successful login, you will see the setup wizard. This is a one-time setup wizard used to set up localization details for your site. Go ahead, select your language, and complete the wizard.

Good job making it this far!

You should see the Desk that looks something like this:

## Site commands

We ran a couple of bench commands with the `--site` option. These commands are called site commands.

Here are some of the useful site commands.

**Python Console**
[code] 
    # access the python console
    $ bench --site library.test console
    Apps in this namespace:
    frappe, library_management
    
    In [1]:
    
    
[/code]

**MariaDB Console**
[code] 
    # access the mariadb console
    $ bench --site library.test mariadb
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 2333498
