You can create tabulated reports using complex SQL queries by creating a new Report. These reports can be created by a System Manager and are stored in the Database

> Note: You will need System Manager Permissions for this.

To create a new Query Report:

### 1\. Create a new Report

  1. Set type as "Query Report"
  2. Set the reference DocType - Users that have access to the reference DocType will have access to the report
  3. Set the module - The report will appear in the "Custom Reports" section of the module.
  4. Add your Query



### 2\. Set the Query

You can define complex queries such as:

SELECT `tabProduction Order`.name as "Production Order:Link/Production Order:200", `tabProduction Order`.creation as "Date:Date:120", `tabProduction Order`.production_item as "Item:Link/Item:150", `tabProduction Order`.qty as "To Produce:Int:100", `tabProduction Order`.produced_qty as "Produced:Int:100" FROM `tabProduction Order` WHERE `tabProduction Order`.docstatus=1 AND ifnull(`tabProduction Order`.produced_qty,0) = `tabProduction Order`.qty AND EXISTS (SELECT name from `tabStock Entry` where production_order =`tabProduction Order`.name)

  1. To format the columns, set labels for each column in the format: [Label]:[Field Type]/[Options]:[Width]



### 3\. Check the Report

### 4\. Advanced (adding filters)

If you are making a standard report, you can add filters in your query report just like [script reports](<https://frappe.io/docs/v14/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/how-to-make-script-reports>) by adding a `.js` file in your query report folder. To include filters in your query, use `%(filter_key)s` where your filter value will be shown.

For example

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE item_code = %(item_code)s ORDER BY ...

### Note: Standard Script Report

If you are developing a standard report for an app, make sure to set "Is Standard" as "Yes"
