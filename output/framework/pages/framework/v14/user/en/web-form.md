Frappe provides an easy way to generate forms for your website with very little configuration. These forms may be public (anyone can fill them up) or can be configured to require login.

## Standard Web Forms

If you check the "Is Standard" checkbox, a new folder will be created in the `module` of the Web Form. In this folder, you will see a `.py` and `.js` file that you can use to configure the web form. These files need to be checked into version control with your custom app. You can install this app on any site and it will have this web form installed.

> `Is Standard` field will only be visible when you are in developer mode.
