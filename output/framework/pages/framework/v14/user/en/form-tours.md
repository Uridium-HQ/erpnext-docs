## Configuration Options

### Form Tour

  1. **Is Standard** : To make a standard Form Tour which will be stored as JSON. Can only be set while developer mode is on.
  2. **Save on Completion** : If checked, the last step of the Form Tour will prompt the user to save the document.
  3. **Show First Document Tour** : If you want to show the tour of an existing document instead of a new form, enable this. As the name suggests, it gives the tour of the very first document created for this DocType.
  4. **Include Name Field** : For some doctypes, the name is set by the user. On enabling this, the name field becomes the first step of the tour.



### Form Tour Steps

  1. **Field** : A field from the selected doctype. This will be highlighted with a Title & Description.
  2. **Title** & **Description** : To describe the field for its use, impact, and other hidden wirings of the field.
  3. **Position** : The position of the highlighting popover is decided by this field. There are multiple options to choose depending upon the position of the highlighted field.
  4. **Next Condition** : A code field which expects a valid JS condition which applies on the document. For eg., for a Task DocType Tour, we can check if task priority is set before going to the next condition by setting next condition as follows:



`eval: doc.priority != ""`

  1. **Is Table Field** : To be checked if the field to be highlighted is under a child table.
  2. **Parent Field** : Table field from the selected doctype. Only visible if **Is Table Field** is checked. Allows user to select a child table field.



## Triggering the Tours

Once you are done describing the Form & its fields, you are now ready to trigger the tour by using Form API. You just have to initialize the tour with appropriate `tour_name` and then simply start the tour with `frm.tour.start()`.
[code] 
    frappe.ui.form.on('Custom Field', 'onload', () => {
     const tour_name = 'Creating a Custom Field';
     frm.tour
     .init({ tour_name })
     .then(() => frm.tour.start());
    });
    
[/code]
