Frappe uses the concept of a "Docstatus" to keep track of the status of transactions. The docstatus will always have one of the following three values:

  1. Draft (value: 0)
  2. Submitted (value: 1)
  3. Cancelled (value: 2)



Documents that are _not submittable_ will always remain in the "draft" state. Documents that are _submittable_ can optionally proceed from the draft state to the "submitted", and then to the "cancelled" state.

Documents in the submitted and cancelled state cannot be edited, with one execption: for individual fields we can explicitly allow edits, even when the document is in the submitted state.

In the backend code we have a helper class `DocStatus` that can be used as follows:
[code] 
    import frappe
    from frappe.model.docstatus import DocStatus
    
    draft_invoice_names = frappe.get_list(
     "Sales Invoice",
     filters={"docstatus": DocStatus.draft()},
     pluck="name"
    )
    
    invoice_doc = frappe.get_doc("Sales Invoice", draft_invoice_names[0])
    invoice_doc.docstatus == DocStatus.draft() # -> True
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_draft() # -> True
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_submitted() # -> False
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_cancelled() # -> False
    
    invoice_doc.submit()
    invoice_doc.docstatus == DocStatus.submitted() # -> True
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_draft() # -> False
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_submitted() # -> True
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_cancelled() # -> False
    
    invoice_doc.cancel()
    invoice_doc.docstatus == DocStatus.cancelled() # -> True
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_draft() # -> False
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_submitted() # -> False
    invoice_doc.docstatus.is_cancelled() # -> True
    
[/code]

The docstatus gets stored as an integer value in each Doctype table of the database.
